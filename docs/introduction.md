There are few basic concepts that are important to understand the ShellHub.
Those basic concepts are detailed below:

## SSH Gateway

The SSH gateway is a SSH server which forward connections to the devices
running ShellHub's agent.

## Device

An internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific like a single-board computer, running ShellHub's agent.

## Agent

ShellHub's agent which must be installed on the device.

## SSHID

SSHID is a unique address to identify a device in the SSH gateway, which must
be specified in the following format:

    <NAMESPACE>.<HOSTNAME>@<SERVER_ADDRESS>

Where:

* `<NAMESPACE>`: Is the account namespace identifier
* `<HOSTNAME>`: Is the device hostname identifier
* `<SERVER_ADDRESS>`: Is the ShellHub server instance address identifier

We are almost done with your account setup process.
Now you need to create a namespace for your account by running:

```
./bin/add-namespace <namespace> <owner>
```

!!! note ""
    Make sure to replace `<owner>` with your account username and
	`<namespace>` with a valid [RFC1123][rfc1123]{:target="_blank"} hostname format.

[rfc1123]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123

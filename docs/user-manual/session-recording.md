!!! info "NOTE"
	This feature is only available in [ShellHub Cloud and self-hosted Enterprise](https://shellhub.io).

By default, ShellHub records all interactive SSH sessions,
which includes all of the user activity that occurs during the session.
Once recorded, it can be played back as a video by namespace's owner in the Web UI.

## Playing recorded session

Go to *Sessions*, locate the session you want to playback and click in the play button at the **Actions** column.

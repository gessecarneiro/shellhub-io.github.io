In ShellHub, users manage devices and collaborate in namespaces. A namespace is a group of devices
and users that is managed by a namespace's owner. An namespace can have any number of members and devices[^1].

The namespace's owner can perform any possible action to the namespace while members have limited access.

!!! warning
	The namespace must be unique across all ShellHub accounts in the server instance and follow the
	DNS label standard defined in [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).

[^1]: [ShellHub Cloud](https://www.shellhub.io/pricing) free tier is limited to up to 3 devices per namespace.
